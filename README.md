# titcut

**titcut** is a lightweight, minimalist video tool for Linux (Hyprland) that lets you:

- Record your screen via PipeWire
- Cut and crop videos easily
- Add text or arrows to highlight content

Built with **Rust** and **Tauri**, titcut leverages **FFmpeg** for fast, hardware-accelerated encoding (Intel iGPU / CPU fallback).
